      "paragraph1": "I'm Beth, a Full Stack Developer from the UK, living in Barcelona🇪🇸. I used to be a dentist 🦷, (possibly holding the title for the youngest ever retired dentist?) before I made the brave leap into tech. I recently graduated from a Full Stack Bootcamp at CodeOp - the best decision I've ever made.  I went from problem solving complex treatment plans to problem solving code - it's pretty much the same thing, right?",
      "paragraph2": "I fell in love with the logic and functionality of code and never looked back. We were so lucky in the Bootcamp to gain experience in a wide range of technologies, but I won't bore you with a list - feel free to dive into my Resume, or check out the videos of my projects.👩‍💻",
      "paragraph3": "'But surely coding isn't all you do?!' I hear you say. Okay, okay, I do have some other hobbies. I love to run, it helps me start the day with a clear head. I love to climb, the sense of fear and accomplishment is addictive. I love eating delicious food with my favourite people. I've been lucky enough to travel to and live in lots of different countries 🇻🇳🇰🇭🇵🇭🇦🇺🇪🇸, helping me to have an open mind and a sense of perspective."
